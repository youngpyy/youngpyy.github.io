## About Me
  
I am **PANG Yeung Yeung (Young)**, a **Research Scientist** at the **Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data (SRIBD)**. My research focuses on **Operations Research in Supply Chains, Data-Driven Operations Management, and Game Theory (Cooperative & Non-Cooperative Analysis)**.

Prior to joining SRIBD, I was a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at **The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen**, focusing on **supply chain optimization, game-theoretic analysis, and data-driven decision-making**. I have published over **ten papers** in **SCI/SSCI** journals, including *Annals of Operations Research*, *Journal of Industrial and Management Optimization*, and *International Transactions in Operational Research*.

I have led projects funded by the **China Postdoctoral Science Foundation** and the **Guangdong Province Joint Fund for Youth**, and have also participated in several **National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)** projects. Additionally, I serve as a **reviewer** for journals such as *Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing* and have industry consulting experience in **operations and supply chain management** at **Polyrock Operations Management Co., Ltd.**.

In recent years, I have contributed to **big data-driven supply chain operation projects** for major enterprises, including **State Grid, Huaneng Group, Huawei, China General Nuclear Power Group, Guangzhou Railway Corporation, Whale Cloud Technology, Wuhan Tobacco Group, and Red Cross Blood Center**.
